# Sketch-It!

## Project Motivation:
To practice vanilla JavaScript, DOM manipulation, and event handling.

## What I Learned:
*Key Technologies/Techniques in Brief*: Vanilla JavaScript, DOM manipulation, event listeners.

In addition to the key technologies listed above, I spent a lot more time planning the logic
and flow of this program compared to my last project (Rock-Paper-Scissors). In that project,
I just jumped into the code and it became somewhat messy. I think that this extra planning 
for the Sketch-It! project resulted in more readable and modularized code. Certainly,
I spent more effort on making short and concise functions (I tried to keep to one action
per function). Toward the end when unexpected challenges came up (i.e., I had not planned 
for them), the code did become messier.

Still, the program is pretty long and I look forward to learning more about code organization
so I can further modularize the program. I will return to refactor the code at that point.

**Note:** this project has poor mobile browser compability. I will try to remedy this in the
future when I learn more about mobile support.
